# admin-dashboard
- Project from 'The Odin Project' to build a generic admin dashboard layout focusing on CSS Grid. I'm using this project to gain experience with CSS grid and intend to not use flexbox.

- The page will contain static dummy content and minimal functionality, as the focus is on layout skills with CSS.
